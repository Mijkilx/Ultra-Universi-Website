    <div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra Univeri is a personal design project focusing on developing art for VR platforms that I have been working on in my spare time.</h3> </div>
    <div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.R opens up exciting avenues for gaming but as of yet the technology isnt quite ready for mass consumption, and the games themselves tend to be fairly simpl and unimaginative .</h3> </div>
    <div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an artist though, my chief concern is how the technology affects development of game art and in particular environmental art.</h3> </div>

    <div class=" title box box2"> <h2>  1: How will the increased vertical F.O.V affect environmental design?</h2> </div>>

<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major differnces between viewing games in VR and viewing on a traditional television is the field of view </h3> </div>
<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional video games have a very narrow field of view on the vertical axis and as a result environments are often created like stage sets to maximise resources.  </h3> </div>
<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players will rareley "look up" in a traditional video game, whereas in VR the desire to look up, down, and in any direction is limitless   </h3> </div>

<div class=" title box box1"> <h2> 2: How will V.R affect the construction of art assets? </h2> </div>>

<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having played a few V.R. games, one of the things that struck me was how the medium reveals the flaws of traditionally made art assets.  </h3> </div>
<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the tricks and shortcuts used to create art assets simply do not hold up in V.R. As such I have decided to try and contruct assets in a manner closer to the real world. </h3> </div>
<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entails giving a bit more attention to the structure of the object, and i have found that using anistropic mapping gives a sense of real-world surfaces. </h3> </div>

<div class=" title box box1"> <h2> 3: General Artistic Research </h2> </div>>

<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond V.R specific aims, I was interested to develop my own artisitc skills. </h3> </div>
<div><h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was especially interested in creating an large coherent environment, as well as devloping my level design and Concept skills in the process. </h3> </div>
